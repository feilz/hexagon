# hexagon
A school project, where we built a hexagon out of wood, and circulated led-lights around the edges.

The application uses the Adafruit_NeoPixel library to control the lights.

The led strips are of the WS2812b model, where each light is individually programmable.

The hexagon will be on display in the Oulu University Tellus innovation arena during december 2016. 

You can modify this code, and upload your own version to the arduino, that is controlling the lights.
Please also upload your changes to Github, and together we can make this piece of art even better.
